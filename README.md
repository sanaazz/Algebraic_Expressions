# Algebraic_Expressions

In this script we implement a program for manipulating algebraic expressions of infix and postfix forms. OUR implementation enables to convert an expression of infix form to postfix form as well as to evaluate postfix expressions.
Our implementation includes the following global functions.
* string infix2postfix( const string exp );
* double evaluatePostfix( const string exp );
